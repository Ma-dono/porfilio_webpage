          About me ?
          <br />
          <br />
          My name: Konan Gnissan Marie-Dominique Noellie. Born in Ivory Coast,
          more precisely in the city of Daloa. This is where I will do all my
          primary and my secondary school. With, initially the desire to become
          a doctor surgeon, my dreams have no continuation when at the
          Baccalaureate, I hardly obtain the grades sufficient to realize them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I then spent, by force of circumstance, my first year of higher
          education in a school specializing in accounting: CPDEC (Centre de
          Preparation aux diplomas de l'Expertise Comptable). Unfortunately, I
          ended up not finding my happiness there and failed miserably in the
          first exams.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is how my older sister, a computer scientist, enrolled me in
          GOMYCODE's Junior Web Developer training, during the holidays
          following the exams. And while I was not expecting it, I obviously
          found a passion for IT in general. I then continued with a BTS in
          computer science and a three-year engineering cycle. I also took care
          to add to my experience other GOMYCODE training such as Coding with
          python, Business technologies, and others.
